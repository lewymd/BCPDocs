**Q:** What's "Weather boost"? 
**A:** Some Pokémon get their level boosted (+5 level) when the weather is right for them. At the time of finding them, we recorded the weather and display together with their stats. If the weather changes later, their stats and level will change.
Note: while the level always increases by 5, IVs do not always increase. Weather might decrease/increase a Pokémon's stat randomly.

**Q:** I spin the PokéStop but I didn't get the quest indicated. Can I speak to the manager?
**A:** Because of shenanigans, you MUST keep an AR quest in your quest stack to get the quests indicated on map. Do not worry about it taking up your quest space, you can still get 3 normal quests like you were. If you have an existing AR quest and the map is still not correct, ping us on Discord.


**Q:** Can I have notification for rare Pokémon please?
**A:** You can get notifications from Professor Poracle


**Q:** I love you guys, what can I do to help?
**A:** You could talk to us about sponsoring a bot to expand the area?

**Q:** IV/Moveset/CP are not correct for me, what gives? 
**A:** IV/Moveset/CP are only accurate for trainers with level 30+. Level up you filthy casual.


**Q:** How to read the IV values for each pokémon?
**A:** Attack | Defence | Stamina.


**Q:** Why are some Pokémon on sighting list not showing up?
**A:** This map only shows non-lured Pokémon. Sighting shows non-lured AND lured ones. Mystery solved.

**Q:** I saw a pokémon on map and when I got there it was something else? WTF?
**A:** This happens when Niantic tweaks the spawn rate of a pokémon. When they do that, a pokémon changes to something else but keep the same IV stats. Unfortunately nothing we can do regarding this, it's on Niantic's side. Good thing is they don't do this very often.


**Q:** Can you show shiny on map?
**A:** Shiny is unique per player, which means a pokémon might be shiny for you but not for other players. So, no.
